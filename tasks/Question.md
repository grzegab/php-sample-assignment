## Would you use a class/library provided by an external framework in your code, why or why not?

### Short answer
Depends. 

### Long answer
Reasons for using external libs/classes:
1. If library/class in widely used, and it is stable (working for a long time without problems) than yes.
2. If this is something new and there is a little possibility that this class/lib won't be supported (low on supporters or no pushes in last time) than no.
3. If writing own library for task would be easy, then no, if that is something big, see point 1 and 2.

examples of libs:
1. Guzzle PHP HTTP - YES
2. mpdf/mpdf - YES, dompdf/dompdf - YES
3. php-flasher/flasher-livewire - NO (only 1k installs, not actively supported)
